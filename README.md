# Demo of using ZingGrid in a React app

This project demonstrates creating and interacting with a ZingGrid instance using React.
It's written using React 17 function components and hooks.

## Running the demo

You'll need an environment with `node` and `npm` installed.
After cloning this repository:

```
cd zinggrid-react-demo
npm install
npm start
```

You should then be able to view the demo in your browser at `localhost:3000`.

## GraphQL server

One of the GraphQL demos uses a server located at [https://examples.zingsoft.com/graphql](https://examples.zingsoft.com/graphql).
If that server is not available, you can run an instance locally. The code is available at:
[https://github.com/zinggrid-demos/graphql-demo-server](https://github.com/zinggrid-demos/graphql-demo-server)

## Starting a new project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) via this sequence of commands:

```
npx create-react-app zinggrid-react-demo
cd zinggrid-react-demo
npm install
npm install zinggrid
npm install react-router-dom
```
